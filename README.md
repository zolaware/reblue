# re:Blue

re:Blue rebuilds Blue Dragon as a native application through static recompilation, translating the original code into something your machine runs directly rather than emulating a console around it. That opens the door to things an emulator cannot reach: higher frame rates, modern resolutions, and real mod support.

- Memory: 16 GB RAM
- GPU: Nvidia RTX 2060 or AMD RX 5700, or equivalent performance & VRAM. 8 GB VRAM for 4K with MSAA
- Storage: 15 GB available space

## How to Install

[Download latest release for your platform](https://github.com/zolaware/reblue/releases/latest) or [build yourself](#building)

1. Blue Dragon shipped on three DVDs, and you will need a disc image of each one from your own copy of the game.

2. Run the executable. A setup wizard will guide you through the rest. You will be asked to point it at each of the three disc images in turn, and it will check each one before letting you continue. Once you pick where to install, the program copies itself there and restarts from that location, so you can delete the folder you extracted the zip into.

3. Pick a graphics quality preset. The wizard copies the game files out of the discs, and you are done. You may also install DLC from this installer or from the main menu under the config menu

The wizard only needs to run once. If something later goes missing from your install, launching with `--repair` reopens it on your existing install and copies back only what it needs.

## Features

Everything below is new to re:Blue. All of it is configurable in game, from the title screen or the camp menu.

### Graphics

- Resolutions up to 4K, windowed or fullscreen, on whichever monitor you pick
- Aspect ratios 16:9, 4:3, 16:10, 21:9, 32:9, plus auto and stretch
- Four quality presets, Low through Ultra
- MSAA up to 8x or SSAA up to 4x
- Anisotropic filtering
- Shadow quality and draw distance
- Depth of field adjustment
- Unlocked FPS with optional caps and VSync

### Quality of Life

- Unlocked frame rate, with optional caps at 30, 60, 90, or 120
- Save from the camp menu anywhere instead of only at save points
- Field of view adjustment, 45 through 120 degrees

- Achievement list viewable in game, with eight new re:Blue achievements alongside the original ones
- Master volume control
- Separate center, rear, and subwoofer levels for 5.1/7.1 tuning
- Fully native keyboard and mouse support with cursor and look modes supported by mouse
- Every controller button rebindable to a key, with mouse sensitivity and cursor opacity of your own
- Menus take the mouse directly: hover a row to move the cursor, click to confirm, wheel to scroll
- Custom input based icons/glyphs for hud elements, following the device you last used or pinned to Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, or Steam Deck
- UI language and voice language chosen separately


### Cheats

A full Cheats page in the config menu, reachable from the title screen or the camp menu. Every setting is live — no restart, no save editing — and each one persists per profile.

**In Battle**

- Invincibility: the party is topped back up continuously, so ordinary fights stop being a threat. A single hit big enough to kill from full HP will still land, and anyone already knocked out stays down
- Infinite MP: cast freely; MP refills as fast as you spend it
- Status Immunity: poison, sleep, petrify and the rest simply stop landing, and anything already on your party is cleared
- One-Hit Kill: enemies are held at 1 HP, so the next hit that connects finishes them. Battles still resolve normally, so you keep the EXP, gold and drops

**Power** — Off / 2x / 5x / 10x

- Attack, Magic Attack, Defence, Magic Defence and Agility: each multiplied independently, so you can turn up exactly what you want
- Permanent Stat Bonus: Off / +999 / +9999 added across the board, for when a
  multiplier isn't blunt enough

Multipliers take effect from the next battle or equipment change.

**Progression**

- EXP per Fight: Off / 2x / 3x / 5x. Levels arrive on the battle that earned them, including several at once
- SP per Fight: Off / 2x / 3x / 5x. Class ranks may not catch up until the following battle
- Gold per Fight: Off / 2x / 3x / 5x
- Medals per Fight: Off / 2x / 3x / 5x, for the ruins-only currency
- Infinite Gold: held at 99,999,999
- Infinite Medals: held at 9,999
- Unlock All Classes: all nine jobs open on every party member, reserves included

**Items**

- Give All Items: one of everything the game defines, in a single press
- Nine targeted grants when you want less than everything: Heal (27), Usable (51), Spellbooks (72), Arm (35), Finger (30), Ear (29), Neck (30), Chest (36) and Valuables (62)
- Infinite Items: every stack you carry stays full, so nothing is spent by using or selling it

Grants add to what you already hold rather than replacing it, hand you one of each, and skip the unused entries that show up in game as Worthless Junk.

**Encyclopedia**

- Achievements 100%: awards the entire catalogue, all 51
- Reset Achievements: locks them all again, if you'd rather earn them

**Debug**

- Console: press `` ` `` to open it, then `game_cheat_diag on` to log a line whenever a cheat acts. Off by default. Every cheat also has a console command
  — `game_cheats` lists the current state of all of them

### Mods and DLC

- Built-in mod manager
- Official DLC is supported

### Platforms and Languages

- Windows on DX12 or Vulkan
- Linux AMD64 and ARM64, including the Steam Deck and other handhelds
- macOS AMD64 and ARM64
- Custom menus in English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish

## FAQ

### Where is my save data and configuration stored?

Everything lives under the folder you installed to:

- Saves and settings: `profiles\default\`
- Your configuration file: `profiles\default\reblue.toml`
- Game files copied from your discs: `game\`
- Mods: `mods\`

### I want to update the game. Will I lose my save data?

No. Copy a newer build over your existing installation and your saves, settings, and mods are left alone. You do not need to reinstall or point the wizard at your discs again.

### How do I install mods?

Use the mod manager in the config menu. It accepts a mod folder or a zip file and puts everything in the right place for you

### Can I keep more than one set of saves?

Yes. Each profile is its own folder under `profiles\`, holding that profile's saves, settings, achievements, and DLC toggles. Launch with `--profile <name>` to pick one, and anything but `default` starts out fresh.

## Building

re:Blue builds with CMake and vcpkg against the [ReXGlue SDK](https://github.com/rexglue/rexglue-sdk).

```sh
cmake --preset win-amd64-release       # or linux-amd64-release
cmake --build --preset win-amd64-release
```

Presets cover `win-amd64`, `win-vk`, `linux-amd64`, `linux-arm64`, `mac-amd64`, and `mac-arm64`, each in Debug, Release, and RelWithDebInfo. A `win-amd64` preset builds both the DX12 executable (`reblue.exe`) and the Vulkan one (`reblue_vk.exe`), and a `win-vk` one builds the Vulkan executable alone. As with running the game, building requires the files from your own copy of Blue Dragon.

## Credits

Huge thanks to everyone who has put time into this. re:Blue would not be where it is without you.
