# re:Blue

re:Blue rebuilds Blue Dragon as a native application through static recompilation, translating the original code into something your machine runs directly rather than emulating a console around it. That opens the door to things an emulator cannot reach: higher frame rates, modern resolutions, and real mod support.

## How to Install

[Download latest release for your platform](https://github.com/zolaware/reblue/releases/latest) or [build yourself](#building)

1. Blue Dragon shipped on three DVDs, and you will need a disc image of each one from your own copy of the game.

2. Run the executable. A setup wizard will guide you through the rest. You will be asked to point it at each of the three disc images in turn, and it will check each one before letting you continue. Once you pick where to install, the program copies itself there and restarts from that location, so you can delete the folder you extracted the zip into.

3. Pick a graphics quality preset. The wizard copies the game files out of the discs, and you are done. You may also install DLC from this installer or from the main menu under the config menu

The wizard only needs to run once. If something later goes missing from your install, launching with `--repair` reopens it on your existing install and copies back only what it needs.

## Features

Everything below is new to re:Blue. All of it is configurable in game, from the title screen or the camp menu.

### Graphics

- Resolutions up to 4K, windowed or fullscreen, on whichever monitor you pick
- Aspect ratios 16:9, 4:3, 16:10, 21:9, 32:9, plus auto and stretch
- Four quality presets, Low through Ultra
- MSAA up to 8x or SSAA up to 4x
- Anisotropic filtering
- Shadow quality and draw distance
- Depth of field adjustment
- Unlocked FPS with optional caps and VSync

### Quality of Life

- Unlocked frame rate, with optional caps at 30, 60, 90, or 120
- Save from the camp menu anywhere instead of only at save points
- Field of view adjustment, 45 through 120 degrees
- Skip the in-game tutorial pages
- Full area map on the world map screen, with zoom, floor switching, and a legend

- Custom input based icons/glyphs for hud elements, following the device you last used or pinned to Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, or Steam Deck
- UI language and voice language chosen separately


### Cheats

- In Battle
    - Invincibility: Refills HP each logic step for living members. A single blow big enough to kill from full still kills; a KO'd member stays down (topping HP over a set KO bit would leave the two disagreeing)
    - Infinite MP: Same for MP
    - Status Immunity: Pins all 11 resistances to the immune threshold and clears anything already applied — resistance only stops the next application
    - One-Hit Kill: Holds living enemies at 1 HP, not 0, so the game's own death path still runs and awards the battle
    
- Power — Off / 2x / 5x / 10x
    - Attack, Magic Attack, Defence, Magic Defence, Agility — five independent multipliers, plus Permanent Stat Bonus (Off / +999 / +9999) writing the seven permanentBonus slots.

    - Applied inside a hook on Player_CalcBattleParams, scaling the block the guest just wrote — so they take effect at the next stat recompute (battle start or equipment change), not mid-battle.

- Progression

    - EXP per Fight: Off / 2x / 3x / 5x Calls the game's own Player_AddExp, so levels resolve immediately, multi-level included
    - SP per Fight: Off / 2x / 3x / 5x Still a direct write — expect class ranks to lag a battle
    - Gold per Fight: Off / 2x / 3x / 5x Snapshot at battle start, top up the remainder at the end
    - Medals per Fight: Snapshot at battle start, top up the remainder at the end
    - Infinite Gold: Pinned at 99,999,999 — the game's own clamps
    - Infinite Medals: Pinned at 9,999 — the game's own clamps
    - Unlock All Classes: Sets all nine class bits on every roster member
    
- Items
    - Give All Items plus nine category grants — Heal (27), Usable (51), Spellbooks (72), Arm (35), Finger (30), Ear (29), Neck (30), Chest (36), Valuables (62).

    - Categories come from the shipped designer sheet, baked into a lookup table. Grants are additive (skip what you hold, fill free slots), give 1 each, and skip the 65 ids the sheet marks abolished — your "Worthless Junk". Infinite Items separately holds every occupied slot at 99.

- Encyclopedia
    - Achievements 100% — awards the full catalog (51) through the game's own unlock path.
    - Reset Achievements — re-locks everything; confirmed to take effect live.
    
- Debug
    - Use ` in game and input game_cheat_diag on for to see active cheat debug in cli

## FAQ

### Where is my save data and configuration stored?

Everything lives under the folder you installed to:

- Saves and settings: `profiles\default\`
- Your configuration file: `profiles\default\reblue.toml`
- Game files copied from your discs: `game\`
- Mods: `mods\`

### I want to update the game. Will I lose my save data?

No. Copy a newer build over your existing installation and your saves, settings, and mods are left alone. You do not need to reinstall or point the wizard at your discs again.

### How do I install mods?

Use the mod manager in the config menu. It accepts a mod folder or a zip file and puts everything in the right place for you

### Can I keep more than one set of saves?

Yes. Each profile is its own folder under `profiles\`, holding that profile's saves, settings, achievements, and DLC toggles. Launch with `--profile <name>` to pick one, and anything but `default` starts out fresh.

## Building

re:Blue builds with CMake and vcpkg against the [ReXGlue SDK](https://github.com/rexglue/rexglue-sdk).

```sh
cmake --preset win-amd64-release       # or linux-amd64-release
cmake --build --preset win-amd64-release
```

Presets cover `win-amd64`, `win-vk`, `linux-amd64`, `linux-arm64`, `mac-amd64`, and `mac-arm64`, each in Debug, Release, and RelWithDebInfo. A `win-amd64` preset builds both the DX12 executable (`reblue.exe`) and the Vulkan one (`reblue_vk.exe`), and a `win-vk` one builds the Vulkan executable alone. As with running the game, building requires the files from your own copy of Blue Dragon.
